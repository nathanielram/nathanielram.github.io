There are several Markdown implementations out there. Kramdown is the default Markdown processor for Jekyll which is used to build this. 
Github Pages also uses Kramdown as the default. While there are certainly other options out there, I'm using Kramdown for the sake of simplicity and the fact that its documentation is rather good (as opposed to RedCarpet for example).

These two links will give you everything you need to know about Kramdown:
